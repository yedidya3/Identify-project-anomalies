# Identify-project-anomalies

The purpose of the project: examining combinations of anomaly detection algorithms.<br />

## Details of the files in Git:.<br /><br />
Folder data_sets - Contains 4 datasets we used in the experiment.<br /><br />
Folder experiment - contains the experiment and its results:<br />
Files list:<br />
data1.ipynb,data2.ipynb,data3.ipynb,data4.ipynb - ipynb files of running the experiment and its results<br />
dect_function.py  - contains the functions of combinations of anomalous algorithm combinations.<br />
precision_m.py - contains accuracy check functions according to the appropriate metrics.<br />
tables.py - contains the functions for creating tables.<br />
handl_anomal.py - contains general auxiliary functions.<br />
<br />
<br />
## An explanation of the notebook's run
Part 1 - Data loading and directional parameters of the algorithms detect anomalies for optimal results<br />
And create a table of comparing the results according to the appropriate metrics<br />
<br />
<br />
Part 2- Using the functions of combinations on anomaly detection algorithms<br />
delete_all<br />
add_and_delete<br />
uniformy_average<br />
ratio_average<br /><br />
Each algorithm receives a dataset and a list of algorithms<br />
A description of the functions can be found in the corresponding file<br /><br />

Part 3<br />
A function of the complex combination that also gives good results can be seen in the corresponding file<br />
combination<br />
